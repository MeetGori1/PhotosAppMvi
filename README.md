**Production-Ready Jetpack Compose Application with MVI Architecture**

Overview

This repository houses a production-ready Android application built using Jetpack Compose and adhering to the MVI (Model-View-Intent) architecture. It's designed to handle real-world development scenarios effectively.

**Key Features**

* **Jetpack Compose**: Modern declarative UI toolkit for building native Android UI.
* **MVI Architecture**: Unidirectional data flow for robust and testable codebase.
* **Kotlin**: Concise and expressive language for Android development.
* **REST API**: Integration with backend services for data fetching and manipulation.
* **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management strategies for user-friendly experiences.
* **Ktor**: Asynchronous network client for efficient API interactions.
* **Coil**: Image loading library for optimized image handling.
* **Navigation Component**: Seamless navigation between app screens.
* **Paging 3**: Efficiently handle large datasets.

The application follows the MVI architecture, comprising:

**Model**: Represents the application's state.
**View**: Renders the UI based on the current state.
**Intent**: Captures user interactions and triggers state updates.
This architecture promotes a clear separation of concerns, testability, and predictable state management.

**Error Handling**

Robust error handling mechanisms are implemented, including:

Network errors
Parsing errors
Business logic errors
UI error states
These are handled gracefully to provide informative feedback to the user.
